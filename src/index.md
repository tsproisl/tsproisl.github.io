![Thomas Proisl](img/thomas_proisl.jpg){#portrait} I am a
computational linguist working as data scientist at the [Federal
Office for Migration and Refugees](https://www.bamf.de).

Before, I was a researcher at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg where most of my
work was in the areas of **natural language processing** (“How can we
make a computer do useful things with texts?”), **corpus linguistics**
(“What can we learn about language using a computer and a large
collection of texts?”) and **digital humanities** (“How can
computational methods help in the humanities, e.g. literary studies,
political science or sociology?”).

<!-- I deeply care about both -->
<!-- **methodology** and **practical implementation**. This means there is -->
<!-- a strong focus on understanding and evaluating established methods -->
<!-- (e.g. “How do Delta measures for authorship attribution work?”, “Which -->
<!-- method yields the best word combinations for inclusion in a -->
<!-- dictionary?”) and on developing novel methods (“How can we measure the -->
<!-- statistical association between arbitrary linguistic constructions?”). -->
<!-- At the same time, I build software solutions (e.g. for identifying -->
<!-- word and sentence boundaries in noisy web and social media texts and -->
<!-- labeling each word with its word class) that combine expert knowledge -->
<!-- with rule-based approaches, traditional machine learning and deep -->
<!-- learning. -->

<!-- Feel free to browse these pages to learn more about my research and -->
<!-- teaching activities. -->
