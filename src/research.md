Most of my work is in the areas of [language
technology](#language-technology), [cooccurrence
phenomena](#cooccurrence-phenomena), and [stylometry/Digital
Humanities](#stylometry-and-digital-humanities). Recurring key aspects
of my research are:

- **Methodology and fundamentals**: My methodological work includes
  the analysis and improvement of established methods, e.g. Delta
  measures for authorship attribution, as well as the development of
  novel methods such as the generalized cooccurrence model. I am also
  involved in the creation of fundamental linguistic resources such as
  a part-of-speech tagset for Albanian.
- **Actual implementation**: My work has a strong practical component
  and I am (co-)developer of several tools and web interfaces, some of
  which represent the state-of-the art in their respective fields.
- **Evaluation**: As part of my research, I assess the performance of
  methods and tools in realistic settings, both to find out which
  established methods and tools work best and to evaluate my own work.


## Language technology ##

I have a strong interest in natural language processing (NLP). So far,
I have been active in the following areas: tokenization,
part-of-speech tagging, unsupervised dependency parsing, sentiment
analysis, and semantic similarity. I am (co-)developer of two
state-of-the-art tools (tokenizer and part-of-speech tagger) for
German web and social media texts.


### Software ###

- [SoMaJo](software.html#somajo): A state-of-the-art tokenizer and
  sentence splitter for German web and social media texts.
  <https://github.com/tsproisl/SoMaJo>.
- [SoMeWeTa](software.html#someweta): A part-of-speech tagger with
  support for domain adaptation and external resources that achieves
  state-of-the-art results on German web and social media texts.
  <https://github.com/tsproisl/SoMeWeTa>.
- [Usurper](software.html#usurper): An unsupervised dependency parser.
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Usurper>.

## Cooccurrence phenomena ##

I am a member in the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Research on
Lexicography, Valency and
Collocation](http://www.lexi.uni-erlangen.de) and a substantial part
of my research is about cooccurrence phenomena like collocations or
collostructions. In my (not yet published) PhD thesis, I developed a
formal model for analyzing cooccurrences of arbitrary linguistic
structures, e.g. dependency graphs.


### Software ###

- [Pareidoscope](software.html#pareidoscope): A collection of tools
  for determining the association between arbitrary linguistic
  structures. <https://github.com/tsproisl/Pareidoscope>.
- [Treebank.info](software.html#treebank.info): A web interface that
  allows linguists to search for dependency structures in corpora.
  <http://treebank.info>.
- [CWB-treebank](software.html#cwb-treebank): An efficient graph
  matching software for dependency graphs.
  <https://github.com/tsproisl/CWB-treebank>.

## Stylometry and Digital Humanities##

I am a member in the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital
Humanities](http://izdigital.fau.de) and a collaborator in the *BMBF
eHumanities Zentrum* [Kallimachos](http://kallimachos.de). My research
areas include authorship attribution and linguistic and stylistic
complexity.
