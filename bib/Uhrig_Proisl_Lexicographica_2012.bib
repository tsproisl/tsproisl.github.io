  abstract =	 {Collocations in dictionaries are often based on
                  automatically extracted candidate lists from large
                  text corpora filtered by a lexicographer. The
                  present paper discusses the two currently most
                  popular approaches to the extraction process, the
                  traditional window-based and the more recent
                  Part-of-Speech-pattern approach. As an improvement
                  on current practices, we suggest to use a third
                  approach to collocation candidate extraction based
                  on dependency-annotated corpora. All three methods
                  are evaluated against an existing collocations
                  dictionary, revealing that the dependency-based
                  approach can in general signifi cantly improve the
                  quality of the candidate lists. Finally, a tool that
                  allows lexicographers to use dependency-annotated
                  versions of their own corpora by means of a simple
                  web interface will be presented.},
