  abstract =	 {Part-of-speech tagging is a basic step in Natural
                  Language Processing that is often essential.
                  Labeling the word forms of a text with fine-grained
                  word-class information adds new value to it and can
                  be a prerequisite for downstream processes like a
                  dependency parser. Corpus linguists and
                  lexicographers also benefit greatly from the
                  improved search options that are available with
                  tagged data.
                  The Albanian language has some properties that pose
                  difficulties for the creation of a part-of-speech
                  tagset. In this paper, we discuss those difficulties
                  and present a proposal for a part-of-speech tagset
                  that can adequately represent the underlying
                  linguistic phenomena.},
