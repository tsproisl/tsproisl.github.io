  abstract =	 {The study of cooccurrences, i. e. the analysis of
                  linguistic units that occur together, has had a
                  profound impact on our view of language. Not only
                  has it contributed greatly to the insight that
                  semi-preconstructed phrases and item-specific
                  knowledge are central to how language works, but it
                  has also led to improved dictionaries and teaching
                  materials. Cooccurrences of various linguistic items
                  have been studied under a variety of names, e. g.
                  collocation, colligation or collostruction. While
                  there are well-understood and fully worked out
                  statistical models for the analysis of cooccurrences
                  of pairs of words, no such model exists for
                  cooccurrences of larger linguistic structures. This
                  situation is remedied by the current work. Building
                  on the well-understood 2 × 2 contingency tables and
                  a graph-based representation of linguistic
                  structures, we develop the generalized cooccurrence
                  model, an explicit formal model for the statistical
                  analysis of cooccurrences of arbitrary linguistic
                  structures. Existing methods for the analysis of
                  two-word cooccurrences and for collostructional
                  analysis are shown to be simply special cases of the
                  generalized cooccurrence model.},
