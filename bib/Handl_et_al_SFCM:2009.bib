  abstract =	 {JSLIM is a software system for writing grammars in
                  accordance with the SLIM theory of language. Written
                  in Java, it is designed to facilitate the coding of
                  grammars for morphology as well as for syntax and
                  semantics. This paper describes the system with a
                  focus on morphology. We show how the system works,
                  the evolution from previous versions, and how the
                  rules for word form recognition can be used also for
                  word form generation. The first section starts with
                  a basic description of the functionality of a Left
                  Associative Grammar (LAG) and provides an algebraic
                  definition of a JSLIM grammar. The second section
                  deals with the new concepts of JSLIM in comparison
                  with earlier implementations. The third section
                  describes the format of the grammar files, i.e. of
                  the lexicon, of the rules and of the variables. The
                  fourth section broaches the subject of the
                  reversibility of grammar rules with the aim of an
                  automatic word form production without any
                  additional rule system. We conclude with an outlook
                  on current and future developments.},
