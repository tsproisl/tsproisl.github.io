  abstract =	 {Burrows’s Delta is the most established measure for
                  stylometric difference in literary authorship
                  attribution. Several improvements on the original
                  Delta have been proposed. However, a recent
                  empirical study showed that none of the proposed
                  variants constitute a major improvement in terms of
                  authorship attribution performance. With this paper,
                  we try to improve our understanding of how and why
                  these text distance measures work for authorship
                  attribution. We evaluate the effects of
                  standardization and vector normalization on the
                  statistical distributions of features and the
                  resulting text clustering quality. Furthermore, we
                  explore supervised selection of discriminant words
                  as a procedure for further improving authorship
                  attribution.},
