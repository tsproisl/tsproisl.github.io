  abstract =	 {This paper describes our approach to the
                  SemEval-2013 task on “Sentiment Analysis in
                  Twitter”. We use simple bag-of-words models, a
                  freely available sentiment dictionary automatically
                  extended with distributionally similar terms, as
                  well as lists of emoticons and internet slang
                  abbreviations in conjunction with fast and robust
                  machine learning algorithms. The resulting system is
                  resource-lean, making it relatively independent of a
                  specific language. Despite its simplicity, the
                  system achieves competitive accuracies of 0.70–0.72
                  in detecting the sentiment of text messages. We also
                  apply our approach to the task of detecting the
                  context-dependent sentiment of individual words and
                  phrases within a message.},
