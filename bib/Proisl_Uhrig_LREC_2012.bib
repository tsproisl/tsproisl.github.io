  abstract =	 {State-of-the-art dependency representations such as
                  the Stanford Typed Dependencies may represent the
                  grammatical relations in a sentence as directed,
                  possibly cyclic graphs. Querying a syntactically
                  annotated corpus for grammatical structures that are
                  represented as graphs requires graph matching, which
                  is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we present an
                  algorithm for graph matching that is tailored to the
                  properties of large, syntactically annotated
                  corpora. The implementation of the algorithm is
                  built on top of the popular IMS Open Corpus
                  Workbench, allowing corpus linguists to re-use
                  existing infrastructure. An evaluation of the
                  resulting software, CWB-treebank, shows that its
                  performance in real world applications, such as a
                  web query interface, compares favourably to
                  implementations that rely on a relational database
                  or a dedicated graph database while at the same time
                  offering a greater expressive power for queries. An
                  intuitive graphical interface for building the query
                  graphs is available via the Treebank.info project.},
