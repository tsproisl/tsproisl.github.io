  abstract =	 {GeRedE is a 270 million token German CMC corpus
                  containing approximately 380,000 submissions and
                  6,800,000 comments posted on Reddit between 2010 and
                  2018. Reddit is a popular online platform combining
                  social news aggregation, discussion and
                  micro-blogging. Starting from a large, freely
                  available data set, the paper describes our approach
                  to filter out German data and further pre-processing
                  steps, as well as which metadata and annotation
                  layers have been included so far. We explore the
                  Reddit sphere, what makes the German data
                  linguistically peculiar, and how some of the
                  communities within Reddit differ from one another.
                  The CWB-indexed version of our final corpus is
                  available via CQPweb, and all our processing scripts
                  as well as all manual annotation and automatic
                  language classification can be downloaded from
                  GitHub.},
