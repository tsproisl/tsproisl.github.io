  abstract =	 {In this paper, we present a gold standard corpus for
                  Albanian part-of-speech tagging and perform
                  evaluation experiments with different statistical
                  taggers. The corpus consists of more than 31,000
                  tokens and has been manually annotated with a
                  medium-sized tagset that can adequately represent
                  the syntagmatic aspects of the language. We provide
                  mappings from the full tagset to both the original
                  Google Universal Part-of-Speech Tags and the variant
                  used in the Universal Dependencies project. We
                  perform experiments with different taggers on the
                  full tagset as well as on the coarser tagsets and
                  achieve accuracies of up to 95.10\%.},
