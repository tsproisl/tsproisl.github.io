  abstract =	 {This paper describes the SemantiKLUE system (Proisl
                  et al., 2014) used for the SemEval-2015 shared task
                  on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) for English.
                  The system was developed for SemEval-2013 and
                  extended for SemEval-2014, where it participated in
                  three tasks and ranked 13th out of 38 submissions
                  for the English STS task. While this yearâ€™s
                  submission ranks 46th out of 73, further experiments
                  on the selection of training data led to notable
                  improvements showing that the system could have
                  achieved rank 22 out of 73. We report a detailed
                  analysis of those training selection experiments in
                  which we tested different combinations of all the
                  available STS datasets, as well as results of a
                  qualitative analysis conducted on a sample of the
                  sentence pairs for which SemantiKLUE gave wrong STS
                  predictions.},
