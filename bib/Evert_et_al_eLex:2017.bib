  abstract =	 {Statistical association measures (AM) play an
                  important role in the automatic extraction of
                  collocations and multiword expressions from corpora,
                  but many parameters governing their performance are
                  still poorly understood. Systematic evaluation
                  studies have produced conflicting recommendations
                  for an optimal AM, and little attention has been
                  paid to other parameters such as the underlying
                  corpus, the size of the co-occurrence context, or
                  the application of a frequency threshold.
                  Our paper presents the results of a large-scale
                  evaluation study covering 13 corpora, eight context
                  sizes, four frequency thresholds, and 20 AMs against
                  two different gold standards of lexical
                  collocations. While the optimal choice of an AM
                  depends strongly on the particular gold standard
                  used, other parameters prove much more robust: (i)
                  small co-occurrence contexts are better than larger
                  spans, and the best results are usually obtained
                  from syntactic dependencies; (ii) corpus quality is
                  more important than sheer size, but large Web
                  corpora prove to be a valid substitute for the
                  British National Corpus; (iii) frequency thresholds
                  seem to be unnecessary in most situations, as the
                  statistical AMs successfully weed out rare and
                  unreliable candidates; (iv) there is little
                  interaction between the choice of AM and the other
                  parameters.
                  In order to provide complete evidence for our
                  observations to readers, we created an interactive
                  Web-based application that allows users to
                  manipulate all evaluation parameters and dynamically
                  updates evaluation graphs and summaries.},
