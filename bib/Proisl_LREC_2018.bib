  abstract =	 {Off-the-shelf part-of-speech taggers typically
                  perform relatively poorly on web and social media
                  texts since those domains are quite different from
                  the newspaper articles on which most tagger models
                  are trained. In this paper, we describe SoMeWeTa, a
                  part-of-speech tagger based on the averaged
                  structured perceptron that is capable of domain
                  adaptation and that can use various external
                  resources. We train the tagger on the German web and
                  social media data of the EmpiriST 2015 shared task.
                  Using the TIGER corpus as background data and adding
                  external information about word classes and Brown
                  clusters, we substantially improve on the state of
                  the art for both the web and the social media data
                  sets. The tagger is available as free software.},
