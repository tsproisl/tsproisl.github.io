  abstract =	 {EmotiKLUE is a submission to the Implicit Emotion
                  Shared Task. It is a deep learning system that
                  combines independent representations of the left and
                  right contexts of the emotion word with the topic
                  distribution of an LDA topic model. EmotiKLUE
                  achieves a macro average F1 score of 67.13\%,
                  significantly outperforming the baseline produced by
                  a simple ML classifier. Further enhancements after
                  the evaluation period lead to an improved F1 score
                  of 68.10\%.},
