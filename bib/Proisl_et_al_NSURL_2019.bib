  abstract =	 {In this paper, we describe the
                  part-of-speech-tagging experiments for Magahi and
                  Bhojpuri that we conducted for our participation in
                  the NSURL 2019 shared tasks 9 and 10 (Low-level NLP
                  Tools for (Magahi|Bhojpuri) Language). We experiment
                  with three different part-of-speech taggers and
                  evaluate the impact of additional resources such as
                  Brown clusters, word embeddings and transfer
                  learning from additional tagged corpora in related
                  languages. In a 10-fold cross-validation on the
                  training data, our best-performing models achieve
                  accuracies of 90.70\% for Magahi and 94.08\% for
                  Bhojpuri. Accuracy increased to 94.79\% for Magahi
                  and dropped to 78.68\% for Bhojpuri on the test
                  data.},
