  abstract =	 {The study of cooccurrences, i.e. the analysis of
                  linguistic units that occur together, has had a
                  profound impact on our view of language. In this
                  talk, I will discuss how we can generalize
                  established methods for the statistical analysis of
                  two-word cooccurrences and cooccurrences of words
                  and constructions, i.e. collocations and
                  collostructional analysis, to analyze cooccurrences
                  of arbitrary linguistic structures. Starting from
                  collocations, I will first discuss collostructional
                  analysis, focussing on simple collexeme analysis and
                  one of its methodological problems. The usual
                  approach to simple collexeme analysis, i.e. the
                  cooccurrence of a construction and a lexeme that
                  occurs in one of its slots, requires the researcher
                  to classify either all constructions in the corpus
                  or all instances of a suitably defined class of
                  constructions. In practice, it is often not possible
                  or feasible to identify these constructions (this is
                  sometimes referred to as “the problem of the
                  bottom-right cell”). The insights gained from the
                  suggested solution to this problem lead towards a
                  generalized cooccurrence model for the statistical
                  analysis of cooccurrences of arbitrary linguistic
                  structures.},
