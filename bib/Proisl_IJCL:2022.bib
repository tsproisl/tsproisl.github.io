  abstract =	 {The aim of collostructional analysis or, more
                  precisely, simple collexeme analysis, is to quantify
                  the statistical association between a construction c
                  and a lexeme l that occurs in a particular slot of
                  the construction. The analysis is based on 2Ã—2
                  contingency tables that ought to represent a
                  cross-classification of the units of analysis. So
                  far, the units of analysis have been identified
                  either as all constructions in the corpus or all
                  instances of a class C of constructions to which
                  construction c belongs. In practice, it is often not
                  possible or feasible to identify these
                  constructions. Therefore, the sample size is
                  typically approximated by heuristic estimates. The
                  bottom-right cell of the contingency table is most
                  affected by these approximations. I suggest that the
                  units of analysis be defined on the word level,
                  instead, as the class W of word forms that satisfy
                  the restrictions on the collexeme slot of c.}
