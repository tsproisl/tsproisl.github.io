  abstract =	 {This article builds on a mathematical explanation of
                  one the most prominent stylometric measures,
                  Burrows’s Delta (and its variants), to understand
                  and explain its working. Starting with the
                  conceptual separation between feature selection,
                  feature scaling, and distance measures, we have
                  designed a series of controlled experiments in which
                  we used the kind of feature scaling (various types
                  of standardization and normalization) and the type
                  of distance measures (notably Manhattan, Euclidean,
                  and Cosine) as independent variables and the correct
                  authorship attributions as the dependent variable
                  indicative of the performance of each of the methods
                  proposed. In this way, we are able to describe in
                  some detail how each of these two variables interact
                  with each other and how they influence the results.
                  Thus we can show that feature vector normalization,
                  that is, the transformation of the feature vectors
                  to a uniform length of 1 (implicit in the cosine
                  measure), is the decisive factor for the improvement
                  of Delta proposed recently. We are also able to show
                  that the information particularly relevant to the
                  identification of the author of a text lies in the
                  profile of deviation across the most frequent words
                  rather than in the extent of the deviation or in the
                  deviation of specific words only.},
