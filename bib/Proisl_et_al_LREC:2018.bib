  abstract =	 {Delta measures are a well-established and popular
                  family of authorship attribution methods, especially
                  for literary texts. N-gram tracing is a novel method
                  for authorship attribution designed for very short
                  texts, which has its roots in forensic linguistics.
                  We evaluate the performance of both methods in a
                  series of experiments on English, French and German
                  literary texts, in order to investigate the
                  relationship between authorship attribution accuracy
                  and text length as well as the composition of the
                  comparison corpus. Our results show that, at least
                  in our setting, both methods require relatively long
                  texts and are furthermore highly sensitive to the
                  choice of authors and texts in the comparison
                  corpus.},
