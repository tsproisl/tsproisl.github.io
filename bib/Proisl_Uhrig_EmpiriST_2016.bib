  abstract =	 {In this paper we describe SoMaJo, a rule-based
                  tokenizer for German web and social media texts that
                  was the best-performing system in the EmpiriST 2015
                  shared task with an average F1-score of 99.57. We
                  give an overview of the system and the phenomena its
                  rules cover, as well as a detailed error analysis.
                  The tokenizer is available as free software.},
