  abstract =	 {Being able to quantify the semantic similarity
                  between two texts is important for many practical
                  applications. SemantiKLUE combines unsupervised and
                  supervised techniques into a robust system for
                  measuring semantic similarity. At the core of the
                  system is a word-to-word alignment of two texts
                  using a maximum weight matching algorithm. The
                  system participated in three SemEval-2014 shared
                  tasks and the competitive results are evidence for
                  its usability in that broad field of application.},
