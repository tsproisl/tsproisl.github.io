  abstract =	 {This paper describes our system entered for the *SEM
                  2013 shared task on Semantic Textual Similarity
                  (STS). We focus on the core task of predicting the
                  semantic textual similarity of sentence pairs.
                  The current system utilizes machine learning
                  techniques trained on semantic similarity ratings
                  from the *SEM 2012 shared task; it achieved rank 20
                  out of 90 submissions from 35 different teams. Given
                  the simple nature of our approach, which uses only
                  WordNet and unannotated corpus data as external
                  resources, we consider this a remarkably good
                  result, making the system an interesting tool for a
                  wide range of practical applications.},
