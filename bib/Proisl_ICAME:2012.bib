  abstract =	 {The present article will introduce the Pareidoscope,
                  a new web-based research tool for exploring the
                  lexis-grammar interface. Its user interface allows
                  the user to explore the interactions between word
                  forms and syntactic structures in an interactive,
                  network-like fashion. Sample analyses will highlight
                  some of the abilities of the Pareidoscope to find
                  associations between structures (which can be
                  partially filled with word forms) and word forms or
                  between the different word forms in a structure.},
