  abstract =	 {In this paper, we describe experiments on
                  part-of-speech tagging of spoken Italian that we
                  conducted in the context of the EVALITA 2020 KIPoS
                  shared task (Bosco et al., 2020). Our submission to
                  the shared task is based on SoMeWeTa (Proisl, 2018),
                  a tagger which supports domain adaptation and is
                  designed to flexibly incorporate external resources.
                  We document our approach and discuss our results in
                  the shared task along with a statistical analysis of
                  the factors which impact performance the most.
                  Additionally, we report on a set of additional
                  experiments involving the combination of neural
                  language models with unsupervised HMMs, and compare
                  its performance to that of our system.},
